| About Us   8 
 DataWorks Plus has developed strategic relationships with product hardware and software suppliers, 
such as MorphoTrak, Crossmatch, and 3M Cogent, in order to achieve a completely open approach 
when recommending the best possible hardware for our all of our software solutions.  
DataWorks Plus is positioned to assist all sizes of agencies with products and solutions for technology 
and service gaps . As experts in our field, DataWorks Plus can provide flexible solutions tailored to 
existing workflows and p rocesses . This allows agencies to transition from existing systems to new or 
additional technologies without compromising current investments.  
DataWorks Plus has five main departments: Sales, Marketing, Engineering, Development and Support. 
Our sales team makes contacts and obtains contracts for the company. In order to do so, they 
coordinate with the marketing department for promotional materials and RFP writing. Once an account 
is obtained, it is given to a project engineer/manager who oversees the implem entation of the proposed 
and agreed upon plan between DataWorks Plus and the Agency. During the implementation phase, the 
project engineer/manager coordinates with our developers, who customize and create the software 
that the agency requires. Once the dev elopment is complete, the project engineer will install the 
software and hardware at the agency’s site. After the installation is complete and the system is in use at 
the agency site, the project engineer or manager hands the account information over to ou r support 
team. The support team maintains and updates the system as required and helps with troubleshooting 
throughout the life of the system. Any issues that cannot be resolved remotely by the support team will 
be handled on -site by our regional support engineers, at strategic locations throughout the country.

 Using the Search Bar  
The “Search” bar at the top of the screen is a power ful “Google - Style ” search that allows you to enter 
any searchable data to find a particular r ecord, lineup, or session. This predictive search tool will query 
every data field within the database for the keyword entered, and display a list of results in order of 
relevance. The result list will show indicate record  fields containing data that match ed the keyword 
entered, such as “first_name” or “last_name.”   
 
 
1. Type Text in the Search Field  
As you type text in the Search field, the system will automatically detect matching records in real -time. 
In the following example, “ alex” has been entered.  Please note that the results in the predictive text 
have all been displayed without actually opening any record or performing a full query.  
 
 
 
You may continue adding descriptive words as desired to dynamically filter down the items in the list. 
For exam ple, by adding “ female” to the search (e.g. “ alex female ”), the list will automatically be filtered 
to only show females containing “ alex” in their data fields, as shown in the following example.

crosshairs may be moved if you wish to fine -tune the image. If you wish to move the feature points, 
refer to the following section: “ Adjusting Features ” on page 81; otherwise, proceed to “Generating the 
3D Model ” on page 82. 
Adjusting Features  
The images will load onto a screen with a feature map on the right showing correct feature point 
placement. Under the menu item “Features”, check the option to Display Feature Map . The Feature 
Map displays the proper anatomi cal locations for each point. You may refer to it while adjusting the 
location of the selected crosshair. When you click one of the crosshairs on the probe image, the 
crosshair on the Feature Map model will be highlighted in green to show you the proper pl acement. The 
green and gray/blue crosshairs may be moved if you wish to fine -tune the image by selecting the option 
Activate Advanced  Features . To reset the feature points to their original locations, select the Reset 
Features  dropdown in the “Features” me nu item.  
Primary (Red) Points  
Click and drag any of the red feature points to their proper location. When the mouse is 
released, the green and gray/blue "secondary" features are recalculated in real time based on 
the "primary" red features. This method of feature point adjustment will be sufficient to 
generate an accurate 3D model in most cases.  
Feature Fine Tuning  
The green and gray/blue secondary features can also be moved if desired. To enable the 
secondary features, select the Activate Advanced  Features  dropdown in the “Features” menu 
item. The secondary features may now be adjusted by clicking and dragging with the mouse. 
The red primary features may also be moved, but if you adjust them when the “ Advanced ” box 
is checked, they system will not automatic ally recalculate the green and gray/blue feature 
points. The green features indicate the subset that have either been detected or manually 
adjusted by the user. The blue/gray set is projected from the generated 3D model.

 Resetting Features  
To reset the fea ture points on an image to the original detected locations, select the Reset 
Features  dropdown in the “Features” menu item.  
Hiding/Showing Features  
To toggle hiding/showing of the feature points on an image, select the Show F eatures  
dropdown in the “Featur es” menu item.  
 
Proceed to “Generating the 3D Model ”. 
Generating the 3D Model  
Once the feature points have been adjusted (if necessary), it is time to generate the 3D model.  
 Category:  Select the category from the d ropdown list that best represents the subject in the 
photograph.  
 Dimensionality: This parameter affects the variability and statistics used in generating the 3D 
geometries. Choose “One Dimensional” for a smooth, generic geometry, “Infinite Dimensional” 
for a more variable geometric structure. “Hundred Dimensional” is a compromise between the 
generic and specific choices. Note: all dimensionality choices may not be available for the 
selected metadata category.  
 2D ->3D Model:  Once the metadata category and di mensionality selections have been chosen, 
click on the 2D -> 3D  button to proceed with the 3D geometry generation. A 3D model 
comprised of both images will be generated.  
 
 
 
The 3D model is comprised of both the probe and result images. You may use the sli der bar to adjust the 
view to show more of the probe or result image.

 Click Close  when you have finished comparing the 3D models. You will be returned to the Compare 
screen.  
Normalizing the 3D Model – Poses and Lighting  
The Normalization  menu contains tools for visualizing the 3D geometries of both subjects 
simultaneously as well as normalizing the lighting in the primary photographs. The Normalization tools 
are not active until a model has been generated with the [2D -> 3D Model]  button. Click the 
Normalization menu. From here, you may change the pose of the 3D model and normalize the lighting 
of the image.  
Choosing a refe rence image/pose  
Clicking on the image thumbnails directly to the right of the subject viewports will change the reference 
pose to match that of the selected image. The 3D model will be rotated to match the selected pose. In 
the following example, the top thumbnail was clicked. Clicking Normalize Pose  will return the 3D model 
to a neutral pose. Reset Pose  will return the 3D model to its previous position, while Lock Pose  will keep 
the model in the current pose.  
 
 
Normalize Lighting  
Clicking Normalize Light ing item in the “Normalization” menu will compute the lighting field on each 
primary view and attempt to normalize the lighting effects on the 3D texture. To toggle between the 
normalized and original lighted textures, select Revert Lighting  or Normalize L ighting  in the menu.

The “Text Pointer”  and “Point”  tools will be described in more detail in the following section 
because they are used to assign points on the image(s), which are then used with the assigned points 
measuring tool.  
MAKING MEASUREMENTS  
Before making a measurement, be sure that the eye locations have been set. See Set Eye Locations for 
Probe Image  on page 86 for more information. You may either meas ure between two assigned points on 
the image or measure the length of a line you draw on the image (no assigned points).  
Assigned Point Measurements  
In order to measure between assigned points on an image, you must first designate the point(s). You will 
need two or more points for measurements.  
Assigning Points  
Two tools allow you to assign points on the image:  
 Text Pointer  
 Point  
To access the annotations toolbar, first click Annotations ON.  The 
toolbar will be displayed. Click  to access the Text Po inter tool. Click 
near  the point you’d like to reference, hold the left mouse button and 
drag to draw the text box. When you release the left mouse button, 
drag the mouse to the location of the point on the image that you wish 

DataWorks Plus  Digital PhotoManager & Facial Recognition  
 
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management  92 
 to reference. When you reach the desired location, click the left mouse button. A line from the bottom 
right corner of the text box will be drawn. Type the text you wish to use to describe this point and press 
[Enter] .   
 
 
In the previous example, we typed “Scar 1” to designate the r ight end 
mark of the scar. Set at least one other point on the probe image. You 
may use the Text Pointer tool again or the Point tool. In the following 
example, we’ll use the Point tool. Make sure Annotations are active. 
Click  to access the Point tool. C lick on the point you’d like to 
reference.  
 
Assign similar points on the results image.  
Measuring the Distance Between the Points  
You may then measure the distance between the points. Below the 
“Zoom”, “Set Eyes” and “Annotations” buttons are two fields that have 
a down -arrow button signifying a drop -down list. Click the drop -down 
arrow in the top field and select the starting point of the measurement (all assigned points will be 
listed).  
  
Click the bottom drop -down arrow and select the ending point o f the measurement. Click the Measure  
button. The length and angle between the two points will be displayed.  
Click the down arrow to display assigned 
points on the image. Select the first 
point from the drop -down list.  
DataWorks Plus  Digital PhotoManager & Facial Recognition

The accuracy of the 3D models generated is dependent upon the accuracy of  the 2D feature points that 
overlay the original images. The feature points are displayed on the image as red, green, and gray 
crosshairs. Verify that the red crosshairs are in the correct place (eyes, chin and ear). The green and gray 
crosshairs may be mo ved if you wish to fine -tune the image. If you wish to move the feature points, 
refer to the following section: “ Adjusting Features  (Optional) ” on page  107; otherwise, proceed to 
“Generating the 3D Model ” on page 108. 
 
Adjusting Features (Optional)  
The image will load onto a screen with a feature map on the right showing correct feature point 
placement. Under the me nu item “Features”, check the option to Display Feature Map . The Feature 
Map displays the proper anatomical locations for each point. You may refer to it while adjusting the 
location of the selected crosshair. When you click one of the crosshairs on the pr obe image, the 
crosshair on the Feature Map model will be highlighted in green to show you the proper placement. The 
green and gray/blue crosshairs may be moved if you wish to fine -tune the image by selecting the option 
Activate Advanced  Features . To reset  the feature points to their original locations, select the Reset 
Features  dropdown in the “Features” menu item.

Primary (Red) Points  
Click and drag any of the red feature points to their proper location. When the mouse is 
released, the green and gray/b lue "secondary" features are recalculated in real time based on 
the "primary" red features. This method of feature point adjustment will be sufficient to 
generate an accurate 3D model in most cases.  
Feature Fine Tuning  
The green and gray/blue secondary fea tures can also be moved if desired. To enable the 
secondary features, select the Activate Advanced  Features  dropdown in the “Features” menu 
item. The secondary features may now be adjusted by clicking and dragging with the mouse. 
The red primary features m ay also be moved, but if you adjust them when the “ Advanced ” box 
is checked, they system will not automatically recalculate the green and gray/blue feature 
points. The green features indicate the subset that have either been detected or manually 
adjusted b y the user. The blue/gray set is projected from the generated 3D model.  
Resetting Features  
To reset the feature points on an image to the original detected locations, select the Reset 
Features  dropdown in the “Features” menu item.  
Hiding/Showing Features  
To toggle hiding/showing of the feature points on an image, select the Show F eatures  
dropdown in the “Features” menu item.  
 
Proceed to “Generating the 3D Model ”.
