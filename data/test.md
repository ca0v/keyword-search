**About Us**

**Mission Statement**

DataWorks Plus was formed in 2000 as a company with a
mission to provide our customers with top-of-the-line
products, versatile applications, and only the best customer
service. DataWorks Plus’ commitment to customer
satisfaction is evident in the customization capabilities of its

products. We realize no two law enforcement or criminal
justice agencies operate under exactly the same set of
circumstances. Because of this, DataWorks Plus’ products
can all be customized to meet an agency’s individual needs
and preferences. DataWorks Plus’ products can be effective for any size agency, whether an agency is a
small town sheriff’s department or a nationwide organization.

Our knowledgeable and friendly support team is available by phone or e-mail to address any
troubleshooting needs your agency may have at any time. DataWorks Plus also offers extensive and
ongoing training for our products, utilizing a “train-the-trainer” approach, ensuring that your agency has
someone on staff capable of training new users in all of the functionality of the installed DataWorks Plus

systems.

DataWorks Plus’ dedication to providing law enforcement and criminal justice agencies with the most
cutting-edge technology, most intuitive and customizable applications, and most attentive and
knowledgeable customer service/support staff in the industry is what the company is built upon. With
such a strong foundation, DataWorks Plus is the premier solution provider in the industry today.

Plus’ team is comprised of the most

```
| About Us 8
```
DataWorks Plus has developed strategic relationships with product hardware and software suppliers,
such as MorphoTrak, Crossmatch, and 3M Cogent, in order to achieve a completely open approach

when recommending the best possible hardware for our all of our software solutions.

DataWorks Plus is positioned to assist all sizes of agencies with products and solutions for technology
and service gaps. As experts in our field, DataWorks Plus can provide flexible solutions tailored to
existing workflows and processes. This allows agencies to transition from existing systems to new or
additional technologies without compromising current investments.

DataWorks Plus has five main departments: Sales, Marketing, Engineering, Development and Support.
Our sales team makes contacts and obtains contracts for the company. In order to do so, they
coordinate with the marketing department for promotional materials and RFP writing. Once an account
is obtained, it is given to a project engineer/manager who oversees the implementation of the proposed
and agreed upon plan between DataWorks Plus and the Agency. During the implementation phase, the

project engineer/manager coordinates with our developers, who customize and create the software
that the agency requires. Once the development is complete, the project engineer will install the
software and hardware at the agency’s site. After the installation is complete and the system is in use at
the agency site, the project engineer or manager hands the account information over to our support
team. The support team maintains and updates the system as required and helps with troubleshooting
throughout the life of the system. Any issues that cannot be resolved remotely by the support team will
be handled on-site by our regional support engineers, at strategic locations throughout the country.

**Left Sidebar**

Using the Left Sidebar, you may create, retrieve, or edit records, as well as create lineups or

facial recognition sessions. The left sidebar can be collapsed to maximize screen space.

After first log in, the left side bar will be in an open state. All other pages will default to a

collapsed display (which can be opened). The application remembers preferences of the left
side bar for the home screen. All other pages will default to a collapsed display (which can be

opened), while the home screen will default to its last state upon return.


###### | 14

**Breadcrumb Trail / Home**

The system will maintain a “breadcrumb trail” for easy navigation to previously-viewed pages within the
application. For example, if a user opens a record from within a lineup session, the breadcrumb trail at
the top left of the screen will allow the user to immediately return to the lineup session.

Selecting the Home option in the breadcrumb trail will take the user back to the home screen with all

previous searches and displays still intact. Any search that was performed, or any display filter added

(records/lineups/sessions; cards/details/images) will remain.

**Record Cards**

A record flip card is a quick way to view

several pieces of information about an

individual in a compact format. The

front view of a record card includes the

valuable per agency. The back of the
lineup card displays SID numbers for
each of the individuals included in the
lineup. The information displayed on
the lineup card is customizable. You

###### | 21

**Using the Search Bar**

The “Search” bar at the top of the screen is a powerful “Google- Style” search that allows you to enter
any searchable data to find a particular record, lineup, or session. This predictive search tool will query
every data field within the database for the keyword entered, and display a list of results in order of
relevance. The result list will show indicate record fields containing data that matched the keyword
entered, such as “first_name” or “last_name.”

**_1. Type Text in the Search Field_**
As you type text in the Search field, the system will automatically detect matching records in real-time.
In the following example, “alex” has been entered. Please note that the results in the predictive text
have all been displayed without actually opening any record or performing a full query.

You may continue adding descriptive words as desired to dynamically filter down the items in the list.
For example, by adding “female” to the search (e.g. “alex female”), the list will automatically be filtered
to only show females containing “alex” in their data fields, as shown in the following example.


###### | 22

If needed, you may apply advanced search logic to predictive text searches, such as “AND,” “OR,” and
“NOT.” These functions can be used to intelligently manage the filtered results within the list.

**_2. Apply the Search_**
Once you have sufficiently entered enough criteria to filter the results,

```
 Click on the desired result from the predictive drop-down list to view that specific result.
 Press [Enter] on the keyboard or click the search button to view all results of the searched
criteria.
```
**NOTE:** You may have to wait several seconds for the search to return results. Currently the system does
not display an additional “waiting” indicator immediately after you begin the search; however, the
internet tab will be spinning.

After several seconds, the system will briefly display an additional spinning/waiting indicator, then the
results will be displayed.

**_3. View Results_**

**_VIEW A SPECIFIC RESULT (SE LECT FROM DROP-DOWN LISTING)_**

Once you have sufficiently entered enough criteria to filter the predictive text results, click on the
desired result from the predictive drop-down list.

```
Internet tab will indicate the waiting
indicator while the system is searching.
```

###### | 23

The user will see the selected corresponding result in the search result pane.

###### VIEW ALL RESULTS (ENTER OR SEARCH BUTTON)

Once you have sufficiently entered enough criteria to filter the results, press [Enter] on the keyboard or
click the search button (without selecting from the drop down menu) to view all results of the searched
criteria. Search Results will be displayed as Records, Lineups, and Sessions. If no result is available the

```
Face Compare Screen – Top Panel Options
```
**Flip Image:** This will Flip the image vertically/turn it upside
down. Note that flipping the image also turned the image’s
display upside down at the bottom of the screen.

**Sharpen Image:** This allows you to sharpen the image. Sharpening seems to bring out image
detail that wasn't there before by emphasizing the edges of an image. It increases the
contrast between each pixel and its neighbors. You will be prompted to enter a sharpening
value. Move the slider on the bar to the left or right or type in a percentage to sharpen the
image by. Select **OK** to apply to adjust the image.

**Contrast:** This allows you to adjust the contrast of the image. Contrast is the difference in
brightness between light and dark areas in an image. You will be prompted to enter a
contrast setting. Move the slider on the bar to the left or right or type in a percentage.
Positive values increase the contrast of the image; negative values decrease the contrast.
Select **OK** to adjust the image.

**Brightness:** This allows you to adjust the brightness of the image. Brightness adjusts how light
or dark and image appears. You will be prompted to enter a brightness setting. Move the

```
###### BOTTOM PANEL OPTIONS

The bottom of the screen provides several tools that you can use to further compare the images. They
include:

```
 Compare
 Composite
 Curtain
 3D
```

```
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management 78
```
The following sections describe these tools in more detail.

Compare
When the **Compare** button is selected, the images will be displayed side-by-side and you may compare
the images by zooming and scrolling them.

_Compare: Zoom_
These sliders allow you to zoom in and out of the image. You can also enter the percentage that you
would like to zoom in the box underneath the zoom slider. Click **Sync** to zoom the images
simultaneously.
Note in the top screen, **Sync** was not
clicked (pressed) before zooming to
217%, so only the left image was
zoomed.

In the second screen, **Sync** was
clicked (pressed) before zooming, so
both images were zoomed
simultaneously to 211%.

_Scrolling_
You may move the image around by clicking on the image and holding down the left mouse button while
you move the mouse. The two Scroll buttons, **Sync** and **Lock** affect how the images move in relation to
one another. When **Sync** is pressed, the images will be brought in line with each other and moved
simultaneously. When neither button is pressed, you may move each image individually. When **Lock** is


```
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management 79
```
pressed, the images will be locked at their current positions and you can then scroll them
simultaneously.

Composite
When **Composite** is selected, the images will be overlaid on each other. You may zoom in on the
composite image by using the zoom slider bar. You may adjust the opacity of the images by using the
**Opacity** slider bar on the right.

Curtain
When Curtain is selected, the left portion of the probe image and the right portion of the result image
will be displayed. You may adjust how much of each image is shown by changing the “Curtain” slider
located to the right of the image. Increasing the curtain number will display more of the left image.


```
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management 80
```
###### 3 D

The **3D** option allows you to generate a 3D model, which is comprised of both the probe image and the
result image. When you click the 3D button, you will be prompted to select the view that best matches
the probe image’s pose.

Click the graphic that best matches the pose of the probe image. You will then be prompted to select
the view that best matches the result image’s pose.

Click the graphic that best matches the pose of the result image. Both images will be displayed as shown
on the following screen.

```
Curtain set to 43. Curtain set to 65.
```

```
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management 81
```
The accuracy of the 3D models generated is dependent upon the accuracy of the 2D feature points that
overlay the original images. The features points are displayed on the image as red, green, and gray/blue
crosshairs. Verify that the red crosshairs are in the correct place (eyes, chin and ear). The green and gray
crosshairs may be moved if you wish to fine-tune the image. If you wish to move the feature points,
refer to the following section: “ _Adjusting Features”_ on page 81 ; otherwise, proceed to _“Generating the
3D Model_ ” on page 82.

_Adjusting Features_
The images will load onto a screen with a feature map on the right showing correct feature point
placement. Under the menu item “Features”, check the option to **Display Feature Map**. The Feature
Map displays the proper anatomical locations for each point. You may refer to it while adjusting the
location of the selected crosshair. When you click one of the crosshairs on the probe image, the
crosshair on the Feature Map model will be highlighted in green to show you the proper placement. The
green and gray/blue crosshairs may be moved if you wish to fine-tune the image by selecting the option
**Activate Advanced Features**. To reset the feature points to their original locations, select the **Reset
Features** dropdown in the “Features” menu item.
**Primary (Red) Points**
Click and drag any of the red feature points to their proper location. When the mouse is
released, the green and gray/blue "secondary" features are recalculated in real time based on
the "primary" red features. This method of feature point adjustment will be sufficient to
generate an accurate 3D model in most cases.
**Feature Fine Tuning**
The green and gray/blue secondary features can also be moved if desired. To enable the
secondary features, select the **Activate Advanced Features** dropdown in the “Features” menu
item. The secondary features may now be adjusted by clicking and dragging with the mouse.
The red primary features may also be moved, but if you adjust them when the “ **Advanced”** box
is checked, they system will not automatically recalculate the green and gray/blue feature
points. The green features indicate the subset that have either been detected or manually
adjusted by the user. The blue/gray set is projected from the generated 3D model.


```
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management 82
```
```
Resetting Features
To reset the feature points on an image to the original detected locations, select the Reset
Features dropdown in the “Features” menu item.
Hiding/Showing Features
To toggle hiding/showing of the feature points on an image, select the Show Features
dropdown in the “Features” menu item.
```
Proceed to _“Generating the 3D Model”_.

_Generating the 3D Model_
Once the feature points have been adjusted (if necessary), it is time to generate the 3D model.

```
 Category: Select the category from the dropdown list that best represents the subject in the
photograph.
 Dimensionality: This parameter affects the variability and statistics used in generating the 3D
geometries. Choose “One Dimensional” for a smooth, generic geometry, “Infinite Dimensional”
for a more variable geometric structure. “Hundred Dimensional” is a compromise between the
generic and specific choices. Note: all dimensionality choices may not be available for the
selected metadata category.
 2D ->3D Model: Once the metadata category and dimensionality selections have been chosen,
click on the 2D -> 3D button to proceed with the 3D geometry generation. A 3D model
comprised of both images will be generated.
```
The 3D model is comprised of both the probe and result images. You may use the slider bar to adjust the
view to show more of the probe or result image.


```
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management 83
```
_Rotating and Translating the 3D Model_
You may rotate and translate the 3D model with your mouse. Click the left mouse button, hold and drag
to rotate the model. Click and drag the right button to translate the model. Click and drag with the
middle button to move the model towards or away from you (zooming in and out).

_Creating a Splitview of the 3D Model_
You may also create a splitview of the 3D model. Select **Split Viewport** from the “Render” menu.

The red line may be rotated. Place your mouse pointer near the top or bottom portion of the line. When
the pointer changes to a circular arrow, hold down the left mouse button and drag.


```
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management 84
```
Click **Close** when you have finished comparing the 3D models. You will be returned to the Compare
screen.

_Normalizing the 3D Model – Poses and Lighting_
The **Normalization** menu contains tools for visualizing the 3D geometries of both subjects
simultaneously as well as normalizing the lighting in the primary photographs. The Normalization tools
are not active until a model has been generated with the **[2D -> 3D Model]** button. Click the
**Normalization** menu. From here, you may change the pose of the 3D model and normalize the lighting
of the image.

_Choosing a reference image/pose_
Clicking on the image thumbnails directly to the right of the subject viewports will change the reference
pose to match that of the selected image. The 3D model will be rotated to match the selected pose. In
the following example, the top thumbnail was clicked. Clicking **Normalize Pose** will return the 3D model
to a neutral pose. **Reset Pose** will return the 3D model to its previous position, while **Lock Pose** will keep
the model in the current pose.

_Normalize Lighting_
Clicking **Normalize Lighting** item in the “Normalization” menu will compute the lighting field on each
primary view and attempt to normalize the lighting effects on the 3D texture. To toggle between the
normalized and original lighted textures, select **Revert Lighting** or **Normalize Lighting** in the menu.

The “Text Pointer” and “Point” tools will be described in more detail in the following section
because they are used to assign points on the image(s), which are then used with the assigned points
measuring tool.

**_MAKING MEASUREMENTS_**

Before making a measurement, be sure that the eye locations have been set. See Set Eye Locations for
Probe Image on page 86 for more information. You may either measure between two assigned points on
the image or measure the length of a line you draw on the image (no assigned points).

Assigned Point Measurements
In order to measure between assigned points on an image, you must first designate the point(s). You will
need two or more points for measurements.

_Assigning Points_
Two tools allow you to assign points on the image:

 Text Pointer
 Point
To access the annotations toolbar, first click **Annotations ON.** The

toolbar will be displayed. Click to access the Text Pointer tool. Click
near the point you’d like to reference, hold the left mouse button and
drag to draw the text box. When you release the left mouse button,
drag the mouse to the location of the point on the image that you wish


```
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management 92
```
to reference. When you reach the desired location, click the left mouse button. A line from the bottom
right corner of the text box will be drawn. Type the text you wish to use to describe this point and press
**[Enter]**.

In the previous example, we typed “Scar 1” to designate the right end
mark of the scar. Set at least one other point on the probe image. You
may use the Text Pointer tool again or the Point tool. In the following
example, we’ll use the Point tool. Make sure Annotations are active.

Click to access the Point tool. Click on the point you’d like to
reference.

Assign similar points on the results image.

_Measuring the Distance Between the Points_
You may then measure the distance between the points. Below the
“Zoom”, “Set Eyes” and “Annotations” buttons are two fields that have
a down-arrow button signifying a drop-down list. Click the drop-down
arrow in the top field and select the starting point of the measurement (all assigned points will be
listed).

Click the bottom drop-down arrow and select the ending point of the measurement. Click the **Measure**
button. The length and angle between the two points will be displayed.

```
Click the down arrow to display assigned
points on the image. Select the first
point from the drop-down list.
```

```
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management 93
```
Perform the same steps on the results image to measure between the two points.

The measurements are not saved, so you may want to create a text box to make notes of the
measurements, as shown in the following screen.

```
Click the down arrow to select the second
point from the drop-down list.
```
```
Then click Measure – the length and angle
between the two points will be displayed.
```

_Manual Measurements/No Assigned Points_
You may still make measurements even if you haven’t assigned particular points, by using the **Manual
Measurement** tool. Click the **Manual Measurement** button, then click on the image at the starting point
and hold down the mouse button to drag to the ending point. A green line will appear on the image and
the measurement will appear in the box to the right of the **Measure** button.

**_Morph Compare_**
Perform facial morphological comparisons based on FISWG’s “Guidelines for Facial Comparison

Methods” standards. This powerful tool will aid investigators when performing facial comparisons and

analysis. Morph Compare is structured upon the FISWG document, which subdivides the face into a list

of “Facial Components” to be compared. Users are guided step-by-step through the analyzation of each

component characteristic and descriptors. Hover over **Morph Compare** on the result image that you

wish to compare to the probe image too.

```
First, click Manual Measurement.
```
```
Second, click on the starting
point.
```
```
Third, hold down the

```
The accuracy of the 3D models generated is dependent upon the accuracy of the 2D feature points that
overlay the original images. The feature points are displayed on the image as red, green, and gray
crosshairs. Verify that the red crosshairs are in the correct place (eyes, chin and ear). The green and gray
crosshairs may be moved if you wish to fine-tune the image. If you wish to move the feature points,
refer to the following section: “ _Adjusting Features (Optional)”_ on page 107 ; otherwise, proceed to
_“Generating the 3D Model_ ” on page 108.

Adjusting Features (Optional)
The image will load onto a screen with a feature map on the right showing correct feature point
placement. Under the menu item “Features”, check the option to **Display Feature Map**. The Feature
Map displays the proper anatomical locations for each point. You may refer to it while adjusting the
location of the selected crosshair. When you click one of the crosshairs on the probe image, the
crosshair on the Feature Map model will be highlighted in green to show you the proper placement. The
green and gray/blue crosshairs may be moved if you wish to fine-tune the image by selecting the option
**Activate Advanced Features**. To reset the feature points to their original locations, select the **Reset
Features** dropdown in the “Features” menu item.


```
| FACE Plus – Facial Recognition Case Management 108
```
```
Primary (Red) Points
Click and drag any of the red feature points to their proper location. When the mouse is
released, the green and gray/blue "secondary" features are recalculated in real time based on
the "primary" red features. This method of feature point adjustment will be sufficient to
generate an accurate 3D model in most cases.
Feature Fine Tuning
The green and gray/blue secondary features can also be moved if desired. To enable the
secondary features, select the Activate Advanced Features dropdown in the “Features” menu
item. The secondary features may now be adjusted by clicking and dragging with the mouse.
The red primary features may also be moved, but if you adjust them when the “ Advanced” box
is checked, they system will not automatically recalculate the green and gray/blue feature
points. The green features indicate the subset that have either been detected or manually
adjusted by the user. The blue/gray set is projected from the generated 3D model.
Resetting Features
To reset the feature points on an image to the original detected locations, select the Reset
Features dropdown in the “Features” menu item.
Hiding/Showing Features
To toggle hiding/showing of the feature points on an image, select the Show Features
dropdown in the “Features” menu item.
```
Proceed to _“Generating the 3D Model”_.

Generating the 3D Model
Once the feature points have been adjusted (if necessary), click the **2D->3D Model** button to generate
the 3D model.

If necessary, select **Normalize Pose** under the menu item Normalization to receive a front-facing image
When finished, click **OK** on the **Pose** window.

 Relational Data: is generally data that may have multiple items associated with them. Your
system may be configured to record data such as Criminal Charges, Aliases, or Scars, Marks, and
Tattoos (SMT) by using a relational table in the database. Since there is extra data associated
with the main item, such as a charge, these fields will generally open a new window where the
additional information can be entered.
```
**_Relational Data_**
Your system may be configured to record data such as Criminal Charges, Aliases, or Scars, Marks, and
Tattoos (SMT) by using a relational table in the database. Relational data is generally data that may have
multiple items associated with them. For instance a charge may have a date, offense code, warrant
information, etc. Since there is extra data associated with the main item, such as a charge, these fields
will generally open a new window where the additional information can be entered. The following sub-
sections serve as examples of what you may see when entering relational data.


```
